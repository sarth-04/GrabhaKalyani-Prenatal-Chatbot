            "Ayurveda offers various natural remedies to help alleviate nausea during pregnancy, often referred to as \"morning sickness.\" Here are some Ayurvedic approaches that may be beneficial:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Ginger**: Ginger is widely recognized for its ability to relieve nausea. You can consume ginger tea, chew on fresh ginger slices, or take ginger candies. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Lemon**: The scent of lemon can help reduce nausea. You can drink lemon water or suck on lemon slices. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Peppermint**: Peppermint tea or peppermint oil can be soothing for the stomach. Inhale peppermint oil or drink herbal tea infused with peppermint leaves.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Fennel Seeds**: Chewing on fennel seeds or drinking fennel tea can help in digestion and alleviate nausea.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cumin Seeds**: Cumin can help with digestive issues. You can boil cumin seeds in water and drink the strained water.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Coriander**: Coriander seeds can also be used to make tea, which may help settle your stomach.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Tulsi (Holy Basil)**: Tulsi tea can be calming and may help reduce nausea. \n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Warm Milk with Turmeric**: Drinking warm milk with a pinch of turmeric can be soothing and help with nausea.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Small, Frequent Meals**: Eating small, frequent meals instead of large ones can help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce nausea.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of fluids, especially ginger or lemon-infused water, can help avoid dehydration and lessen nausea.\n",
            "\n",
            "11. **Avoid Strong Odors**: Try to avoid strong smells that may trigger nausea. Fresh air can also be beneficial.\n",
            "\n",
            "12. **Rest and Relaxation**: Adequate rest and practicing relaxation techniques like breathing exercises or gentle yoga can help reduce stress and nausea.\n",
